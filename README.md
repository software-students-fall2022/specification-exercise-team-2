### Brian Park, a student at NYU 

#### Goal:

1. Save memories such as photos, videos, or text shared with my friends and family. 
2. Categorize those into groups and be able to store and retrieve easily anytime I want. 
3. Keep in contact with my friends and family abroad and let them know how I am doing. 
4. Be able to see how my little sister is doing and how well she is growing up. 
5. Be able to find and look back into memories easily without spending too much time organizing the drive or photo album.
