## Stakeholders

### Brian Park, a student at NYU 

#### Goals/needs:

1. Save memories such as photos, videos, and text in a space shared with my friends and family. 
2. Categorize these memories into groups for easy storage and access. 
3. Keep in contact with my friends and family abroad and let them know how I am doing. 
4. Be able to see how my little sister is doing and how well she is growing up. 
5. Be able to find and look back at memories easily without spending too much time organizing a drive or photo album. 

#### Problems/Frustrations

1. Hard to find memories from my photo album since they are all stacked together.
2. Hard to organize memories on alternative platforms like Google Drive or Dropbox.
3. Alternative platforms such as Dropbox do not allow captions or texts on photos or videos. 
4. Hard to add each person to each Drive and make groups for each memory.
5. Alternative platforms such as Instagram or Facebook are mostly for public groups. 

### Jenna Al Enazi, a student at Goldsmiths University of London

#### Goals/Needs

1. Be able to save photos, videos, docs etc. with my friends and family while offline. 
2. Have easy to use edit functionalities, such as easily accessible shortcuts to different templates. 
3. Have it be user friendly for family and friends of all ages.
4. Be able to easily undo an upload or edit. 

#### Problems/Frustrations 

1. Difficulty sorting my images/docs in a time efficient way (organizational issues).
2. Most applications with similar functionalities to this platform can be visually loud, making it difficult to use.
3. Other platforms do not work offline, so some miss out. 
4. Templates are not often provided, which can make editing difficult for those with no editing skills (all ages). 

## Product Vision Statement
A mobile application where friends and family can create private groups for sharing memories or the activities of their daily lives.

## User Requirements

1. As a college student, I want to be able to keep up with my friends from home so that we can update each other on our achievements and support each other, without the pressure to message each other all the time.
2. As a grandmother who has many of our old family photos, I want a centralized area where I can share the memories I have collected over the years, and fill in the gaps with the other memories that my family has collected.  
3. As an older brother, I want to be able to see how my younger sister is doing in a more safe environment where she will not be exposed to the usual side effects of social media.
4. As an organized college student, I want to be able to create channels for my project and be able to leave my opinions on what my group members add, so that similar media is easy to find and our opinions can be taken into account.
5. As a college student who is part of messaging apps, I want an app that is more focused on sharing media so that I can keep them organized and all in one easily accessible place, while separating them by my friend groups. 
6. As a daughter whose parents are not the most tech savvy, I want to be able to invite my older family members to a platform where they can focus only on uploading photos and media, and easily see the media that I want them to have.
7. As a college student who is not too fond of social media, I want a space that feels more private without the noise from other peoples posts and opinions.
8. As a person who is part of very different social groups, I want to be able to decide which groups can share our photos publicly and which groups I want to be private.
9. As a college student who does not have much storage on my phone, I want a cloud-like place where I can keep all my media that my loved ones share with me.
10. As a family member, I want to be able to let my family know my thoughts about the images they collect.
